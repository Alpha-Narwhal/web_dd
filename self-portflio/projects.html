            <p id="p1-desc">"Dangerscape USA" was developed during BYU-Idaho's I-Hack 24-hour hackathon, where I worked with a team of four. This project features a map that displays every county in the USA, assessing various dangers including auto accidents, natural disasters, and violent crime. Each category is broken down into subcategories, providing a comprehensive danger rating for each county, with filter options to customize the data view.</p>
