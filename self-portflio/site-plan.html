      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        **Introduction**: Welcome to my portfolio! This page is a living list of projects I've created or been a part of. As I continue to explore and develop my skills in cybersecurity, I'll be adding new projects and updates here. Below, you'll find the details of my first project, "Dangerscape USA."
      </p>
      <p>
        **Project 1: Dangerscape USA**: "Dangerscape USA" was developed during BYU-Idaho's I-Hack 24-hour hackathon, where I worked with a team of four. This project features a map that displays every county in the USA, assessing various dangers including auto accidents, natural disasters, and violent crime. Each category is broken down into subcategories, providing a comprehensive danger rating for each county, with filter options to customize the data view.

        **My Contributions**:
        - **Map API Integration**: Ensured the map API was functional and interactive, allowing seamless integration with our team's database.
        - **Webpage Design**: Designed the entire webpage that hosts the map, including HTML and CSS design.
        - **Concept Development**: Assisted the team leader in developing ideas for the danger ratings, importance levels, and formulas for calculating scores.
        - **Supporting Roles**: Filled in gaps to allow other team members to focus on more complex tasks, ensuring a cohesive and high-quality final product.

        You can view the project [link to the project here].
